Deep learning is a novel machine learning technique that can be used to generate relevant insights from large volumes of data. The term Deep Learning was coined in 2006 by Geoffrey Hinton to refer to algorithms that enable computers to analyze objects and text in videos and images. Fundamentally, deep learning algorithms are designed to analyze and use large volumes of data to improve the capabilities of machines. Companies, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, IBM and Netflix, are already using deep learning algorithms to analyze users' activities and make customized suggestions and recommendations based on individual preferences. Today, in many ways, deep learning algorithms have enabled computers to see, read and write. In light of recent advances, the error rate associated with machines being able to analyze and interpret medical images has come down to 6%, which, some research groups claim, is even better than humans.
