**Hyderabad, India and Seoul, South Korea,  Tuesday, 15th September, 2020:**  Standigm Inc., a company using artificial intelligence (AI) technology for drug discovery and development announced its collaboration with Excelra, a global data and analytics company for small molecule medicinal chemistry intelligence data.  

Under the agreement Excelra will provide its GOSTAR Platform to Standigm Inc.. GOSTAR Platform encompasses over 8 million compounds manually curated from 3 million patents and 400,000 journals. The database contains over 28 million associated SAR data points. The well-structured relational database can be utilised for diverse applications across different stages of the drug discovery and development lifecycle and aids in Target Validation, HIT Identification and early Lead Identification, and Optimization.   

**Hanjo Kim, Platform Team Leader, Standigm Inc., said:** “For AI-based drug discovery company, high quality SAR data is of great importance. Our platform technologies, Standigm BEST<sup>TM</sup>, Standigm ASK<sup>TM</sup>, and Standigm Insight<sup>TM</sup> integrate lots of data to generate innovative ideas including finding novel targets, developing predictive models, and designing novel lead series compounds. I expect GOSTAR can help this process.” 

**Raveendra Dayam, Director Chemistry Services, Excelra said:** “GOSTAR is the largest source for experimentally determined interactions of millions of small molecules with most of the potential drug targets. The platform provides a comprehensive overview of millions of compounds, linking chemical structure to biological, pharmacological and therapeutic activities.  These datasets are core to the AI/ML driven drug discovery programs that support rapid discovery of novel drug candidates.”
