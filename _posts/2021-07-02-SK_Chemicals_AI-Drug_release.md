SEOUL, South Korea--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home))--Standigm Inc. (“Standigm”), a leading workflow artificial intelligence (AI) drug discovery company, and SK Chemicals Co., Ltd (“SK Chemicals”), a life science and green chemicals company, announced today that they have signed a strategic partnership contract for collaboration regarding clinical development of Standigm’s AI-driven drug candidate for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and the foundation of Standigm’s Synthesis Research Center within the headquarters of SK Chemicals. This partnership was made in conjunction with SK Chemicals’ participation in Standigm’s pre-IPO round of fundraising.

Under the contract, SK Chemicals will collaborate with Standigm on the clinical development of the NASH drug candidate discovered by Standigm Insight™, an AI-aided drug-repurposing platform, which is expected to enter clinical stage next year.
