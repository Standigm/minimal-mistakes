                    The goal of the project is to predict synergetic drug combinations that
                    effectively kill cancer cells. The disease context, the characteristics of drugs,
                    and the interaction between drugs and diseases are described using various chemical
                    properties of drugs, target proteins/signaling pathways of drugs, monotherapy drug
                    response data and genomic data for cell lines, among others. Based on these data,
                    we designed three types of input features (cell line-specific, drug-specific,
                    and drug-cell line interaction features). With various combinations of these features
                    and different learning parameters, we built an ensemble of gradient boosting classifiers,
                    which ranked 3rd among 71 teams worldwide in "AstraZeneca-Sanger Drug Combination
                    Prediction Dream Challenge (2015~2016)". The methods will be applied to precision
                    medicine, patient stratification, and therapeutic/diagnostic design.

                    The goal of the project is to predict new indications for existing drugs,
                    called drug repositioning, from the features of drug responses and drug uses
                    discovered via deep learning. Here, the drug responses and uses are described
                    by the data of drug-perturbed gene expressions and of therapeutic usage labels,
                    respectively. We have been developing various multimodal learning methods
                    (XGBoost, Compact Bilinear Pooling, etc.) for robust feature learning.
                    These models suggest 20 hits with new drug indications. For two of the 20 drug
                    repositioning hits, literature has shown their experimental validations. For the
                    remaining hits, Standigm is designing in-vivo and in-vitro experimental validations
                    to demonstrate Standigm.AI’s prediction power. Our drug repositioning AI will discover
                    hidden relational patterns of drugs and indications, ultimately saving the cost of drug
                    development.

                    The goal of the project is to predict missing relationships between proteins, drugs, and diseases by learning from a biological knowledge GraphDB. We constructed the biological GraphDB consisting of nodes (32,373 proteins, 7815 drugs, 3721 diseases, etc.) and edges (55,618 drug-disease edges, 125,686 drug-protein edges, etc.) using knowledge from various open and private sources. Users can easily access and visualize the GraphDB via web browsers and navigate the DB using the Cypher query language. We are developing models to predict unknown links between the nodes (proteins, drugs, disease etc.) in the GraphDB. The models will be applied to finding new drug indications, new drug targets, and new disease biomarkers.
